## Objective of Study
The main objectives of this study are:
- Investigating the relationship between key economic indicators and household debt, including GDP, GDP growth rate, Non-Performing Loans (NPLs), and interest rates.
- Forecasting the trajectory of household debt in Thailand.

### Key Variables
- **Dependent Variable (y):** Household Debt per Year
- **Independent Variables (x):**
  - GDP
  - GDP Growth Rate
  - Mean of Policy Interest Rates
  - Total Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)

## Data Sources

- Bank of Thailand

## Scope of Study
This analysis is based on data spanning from **2013 to 2021** (9 years).

## Methodology for Analysis
The analysis will involve the following steps:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Gathering datasets from multiple sources.
- Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data exploration through statistical summaries and visualizations.

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Identifying relationships between variables.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Testing statistical hypotheses to validate assumptions.

### 5. Predictive Modeling
